# biketag-website
[![Build Status][travis-image]](travis-url)

A website for biketag.org

## why?
To allow anyone and everyone to play biketag! This site will ingest the Reddit posts playing biketag for a configured subreddit, and display them on biketag. Conversely, using the site you can create a new tag and will be automagically posted to Reddit! This lets anyone play the game without needing to know how to imgur or having a reddit account, while continuing to support those who have been playing biketag on reddit as well!

## features
* See current tag, previous proof tag, and original previous tag: http://biketag.org
* Tag new location (provide next tag image, proof tag image, name, and other information like location): http://biketag.org/#tagit
* See all historic tags: http://biketag.org/?count=all
* See individual tags with original tag and found it tag: http://biketag.org/?tagnumber=95
* Only region that is currently up and running is http://pdx.biketag.org, which the homepage mirrors. Other regions are supported, though not set up.
