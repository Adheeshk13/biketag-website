    BikeTag is a mystery photo tag game played on bicycles. BikeTag.Org is a place for people to see
    the most recent Bike Tags in their city and participate in the game in an easy and simple way,
    without needing to login to anything. The origins of the game of BikeTag, as far as we have been
    able to track, put the game in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 2007. BikeTag on Reddit was started on
    in 2011 on /r/BikingATX, that was then adopted by /r/bikeLA, that was then adopted by
    /r/chibike. The game in /r/CyclePDX was created in 2016 and this website was created in 2018 as
    a tool for the game in Portland, Oregon.
