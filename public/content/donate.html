    this website is open source and tracked on
    <a href="https://github.com/KenEucker/biketag-website">github</a>. This code is free to use or
    modify and is maintained by volunteers all over the world.

    The web application that serves [City].BikeTag.Org uses the following platforms either through
    console administration or API consumption. These technologies are used at minimum levels to
    reduce costs, in some cases to $0. As BikeTag.Org scales, this technology list may grow and the
    costs to maintain these services will increase.
