This is Minnesota’s largest online sport bike community (MNSBR), a motorcycle community. User going by the handle “Thor” makes this post:
Since I will be teaching most weekends this year, I was trying to think of fun things to do on the bike. This has been done many times on other forums over the years and I thought it might be fun here.
Photo Tag:

<pre>
	1. Take a photo of your bike near a landmark, sign, etc... You can include some clues with the photo.
	2. Ride to that location and take a picture of your bike there. The first person to tag the location with a photo gets to put up the next photo of their bike at another location.
	3. If no one is getting the location, you can give more and more clues, but can't give out the actual location. Saying what the location is without a picture of your bike there is just not cool
	4. I want to limit this to the general metro area so as many people can participate as possible
	
	It will be at least a week until I can ride, so I don't have a photo for your right now. What do you think?
