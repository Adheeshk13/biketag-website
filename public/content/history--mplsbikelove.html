A user “Zip” makes this post:
With inspiration from the MNSBR forum, I'd like to introduce The Photo Tag Game. The rules are simple:
<pre>
	1. Find the last untagged photo in the thread, ride to that location and take a picture of your bike in that same spot.
	2. Reply with that picture and a new photo (including your bike) that someone has to tag.
	3. The pictures must be within the 694/494 loop.
	4. Saying where the last photo was taken without a picture is not allowed.
</pre>
